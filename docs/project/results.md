##AvrPtoB interacts with CERK1 and impairs CERK1-mediated immune responses

Effectors often target PRRs, the CERK1-AvrPtoB interaction seems to be an exception. To be able to disrupt the interaction, we first need to verify that AvrPtoB indeed targets CERK1 and analyse the effect of AvrPtoB on the CERK1 mediate immune response.

**Aim:** Prove AvrPtoB targets CERK1 and leads to impaired immune response.
A Y2H plate assay was performed using AvrPtoB and CERK1 fused to both DBD and AD interchangeably (**Fig. 1**). In this assay, cells grow in a selective medium (-LWU) if an interaction between the proteins is present. The experiment group of DBD-CERK1 and AD-AvrPtoB showed high levels of growth, superseding even the established positive control protein pair (Antigen T and p53). This confirms a strong interaction between our two proteins of interest.

To follow this up, we wanted to ensure that AvrPtoB did indeed impair the immune response of plants. We treated plants with chitin to simulate a fungal infection, triggering the CERK1-mediated immune response. The intensity of the immune response can be quantified by measuring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst following the chitin treatment (Fig. 2). When we transiently transformed the plants with an estradiol-inducible AvrPtoB DNA construct (XVE/OlexA-AvrPtoB) and the treated the plants with estradiol, the ROS burst was significantly reduced, indicating that AvrPtoB indeed impairs CERK1’s functions.

**Conclusion:** AvrPtoB binds CERK1 and impairs CERK1-mediated immune responses. However, the fusion of DBD and AD in the Y2H seems to affect the interaction. This can be seen as in one sense, the interaction is strong, and in the other sense there is little growth compared to negative controls. This indicates a false negative, and a need for a more robust system.
